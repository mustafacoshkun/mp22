Contribution of the Course to the Program

We are learning about the next generation mobile development SDK of the industry, which has been making a sound since the first day it was released.
While learning the Dart language with an original educational methodology, a model has been implemented that will instantly teach the Flutter equivalent. This educational model will allow you to learn Flutter with logic, not by rote.
Flutter offers a powerful mobile development environment with Google behind it. Unlike other cross platform mobile development products, it offers a full native experience. You will have both iOS and Android mobile product at the same time. You will also be able to use Flutter codes for web and desktop development. In short, you will have Android & iOS & Web & Desktop software with a single code infrastructure.
The course syllabus has been kept as rich as possible. You will encounter content that starts from scratch but carries you to structures such as the BLoC pattern.
